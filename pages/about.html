Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer specializing in backend development, cloud services, and AI solutions. With expertise in Python, JavaScript, Node.js, and frameworks like Django and React, I deliver scalable solutions across finance, technology, e-commerce, and multimedia sectors.

Currently working remotely with Simplified, TLDR Technologies Inc, I lead projects in AI-powered video automation and media processing, optimizing cloud infrastructure and enhancing database performance. Previously at Aubergine Solutions Pvt Ltd, I developed backend applications with GraphQL and Django and led e-commerce initiatives. My early career at Nividata Consultancy provided a strong foundation in fintech and blockchain technology.

My background in Information Technology and certifications in Scrum Mastery reflect my dedication to continuous learning and innovation.
